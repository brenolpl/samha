In this project, I explored many technologies, with the objective of migrating a Java Swing application to a whole new web application.

The backend was reformulated from the commonly used 5-layered architecture to Clean Architecture, using Spring Boot and applying REST pattern to the API calls.

Using Angular to the front end, one of the most challenging this was to build a matrix 5×6 that uses drag-and-drop to allow user interaction, data modification and constraints check.

The software was designed to help the coordinators of the Federal Institute of Espírito Santo — Colatina Campus by managing teacher allocation throughout many courses in three available class times (morning, afternoon, noon).

Spring Security was used to control authentication and authorization by checking JWT secret that is stored on user's browser.

In this project, I achieve to improve the user experience by 100%, reduce workload of the coordinators of generating reports by exposing specific public routes to access the reports in the application and reduce paper impression.

This project it was part of my Final Paper, and was published by the Revista Contemporânea magazine and became a software that it is used by the federal government of Brazil, available at: http://samha.colatina.ifes.edu.br/

This was an amazing opportunity to grow as a developer, to every teacher that made this possible: Thank you! :)
